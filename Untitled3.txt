</sp>

 summer of 1998 when the film originally aired.]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Chinese guard is seen walking on The Great Wall. Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and hits the<sp>
</sp>

 guard on the head knocking his helmet off. The falcon lands on top of a flag pole in front of a<sp>
</sp>

 full moon and lets out a large cry. One grappling hook comes over The Great Wall. The guard walks<sp>
</sp>

 over to the edge and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Guard [yelling]: We're under attack! Light the signal!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long Hair Man appear<sp>
</sp>

 trying to stop him. Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with his sword just as Guard reaches the<sp>
</sp>

 top. The guard picks up the torch to light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the<sp>
</sp>

 tower and looks at him across from the caldron. The guard throws the torch into the caldron<sp>
</sp>

 lighting a large fire. Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons one by one]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Guard [sternly]: Now all of China knows you're here.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]: Perfect.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the palace. The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li walks in flanked<sp>
</sp>

 on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. He bows, then looks up]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;General Li: Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall. [The Emperor motions for Chi Fu's<sp>
</sp>

 silence]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;General Li: Shun-Yu is leading them. We'll set up defenses around your palace immediately.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor [forcefully]: No! Send your troops to protect my people. Chi Fu, &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Yes, your highness.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces. Call up reserves and as<sp>
</sp>

 many new recruits as possible.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;General Li: Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: I wont take any chances, General. A single grain of rice can tip the scale. One man<sp>
</sp>

 may be the difference between victory and defeat.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the mound of<sp>
</sp>

 rice]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her chopsticks and<sp>
</sp>

 eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets down her chopsticks and writes down a<sp>
</sp>

 final word on her right arm] punctual. [A cock crows] Aiya. [Calling out] Little brother. Little<sp>
</sp>

 brother. Lit- ahhh, there you are. Who's the smartest doggie in the world? Come on smart boy, can<sp>
</sp>

 you help me with my chores today?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan ties a sack of grain around Little Brother's waist. She ties a stick onto Little brother<sp>
</sp>

 so that end of it is in front of Little Brother's face. She ties the bone on the end of the stick<sp>
</sp>

 just out of reach. Little Brother begins to run after the bone which he cannot reach. Mulan opens<sp>
</sp>

 the door for Little Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the open door. Little<sp>
</sp>

 brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan's Father, Fa Zhou, kneeling and praying before the Fa family's ancestors]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker today. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Little Brother [running into the temple and around Fa Zhou scattering grain around the floor]:<sp>
</sp>

 Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The chickens follow Little Brother into the temple and begin to feed on the grain]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: Please, PLEASE, help her.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to get the bone.<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the bone. Little brother gnaws on the<sp>
</sp>

 bone happily. Mulan continues toward the temple]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [calling out]: Father I brought your--whoop! [Fa Zhou bumps into Mulan. The cup falls to<sp>
</sp>

 the ground and Fa Zhou catches the teapot with the handle of his cane]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: Mulan--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: I brought a spare. [Mulan pulls out a cup from underneath the back of her dress and<sp>
</sp>

 begins to pour the tea] &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: Mulan--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [hurried]: Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: Mulan--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: And three at night. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: Mulan, you should already be in town. We're counting on you to up--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: --uphold the family honor. Don't worry father. I wont let you down. [Mulan covers over<sp>
</sp>

 the writing on her arm with here sleeve] Wish me luck. [Mulan hurries down the stairs]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou [calling out]: Hurry! [to himself] I'm going to...pray some more. [Fa Zhou turns and<sp>
</sp>

 walks back into the temple]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the town with Fa Li looking worried]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Bath Lady [poking out of her building]: Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? The matchmaker is not<sp>
</sp>

 a patient woman. [She goes back into the building]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li: Of all days to be late. I should have prayed to the ancestors for luck.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]: How lucky can they be, they're dead. Besides,<sp>
</sp>

 I've got all the luck we'll need. [Speaking to Cri-Kee] This is your chance to prove yourself.<sp>
</sp>

 [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li [excitedly]: Grandma No!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street. But two horse and<sp>
</sp>

 carriage collide causing a big accident. She arrives at the other side of the street, uncovers<sp>
</sp>

 here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa: Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of fright]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li [sighing in relief]: Hai.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and jumps off with hay<sp>
</sp>

 stuck in her hair]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: I'm here. [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What? But Mama I had to--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li: None of your 'xcuses. Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk together into the<sp>
</sp>

 preparation area]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Song: Honor to us all]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Bath Lady: [all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the Bath] This is what<sp>
</sp>

 you give me to work with? Well, honey, I've seen worse. We're gonna turn this sow's ear Into a<sp>
</sp>

 silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in the bath] &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [spoken]: It's freezing.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li [spoken]: It would have been warm if you were here on time. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Bath Lady [washing Mulan's hair]: We'll have you Washed and dried Primped and polished till you<sp>
</sp>

 glow with pride Trust my recipe for instant bride You'll bring honor to us all&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li [grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her. She notices the writing]<sp>
</sp>

 [spoken]: Mulan, what's this?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes] [spoken]: Ahh, notes, in case I forget<sp>
</sp>

 something?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa [spoken]: Here, hold this [hands the cricket to Fa Li]. We'll need more luck than I<sp>
</sp>

 thought. [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the hair dressers]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hair Dresser 1 [Brushing and combing Mulan's hair much to Mulan's chagrin]: Wait and see When<sp>
</sp>

 we're through&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hair Dresser 2: Boys will gladly go to war for you&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hair Dresser 1: With good fortune &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hair Dresser 2 [Finalizing the hairdo to look exactly like hers]: And a great hairdo&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Both: You'll bring honor to us all&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li and others: [Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and pauses to make an<sp>
</sp>

 impressive move. Mulan has a smug look on her face when Fa Li comes back and drags Mulan away] A<sp>
</sp>

 girl can bring her family Great honor in one way By striking a good match And this could be the<sp>
</sp>

 day&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Dresser 1 [Dresser 1, Dresser 2, and Fa Li dress Mulan]: Men want girls with good taste&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Dresser 2: Calm&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li: Obedient&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Dresser 1: Who work fast-paced&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li: With good breeding&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Dresser 2 [Pulling the dress tight around her waist]: And a tiny waist &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [expressing her waist being squeezed tight] [spoken]: huh.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;All Three: You'll bring honor to us all &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chorus: [Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl. Mulan grabs the doll<sp>
</sp>

 from the boy and returns it to its owner] We all must serve our Emperor Who guards us from the<sp>
</sp>

 Huns A man by bearing arms A girl by bearing sons &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Make-up Lady/Fa Li: [Putting on Mulan's face, powder, lipstick and eye liner] [in a 3 person<sp>
</sp>

 round] When we're through you can't fail Like a lotus blossom soft and pale How could any fellow<sp>
</sp>

 say "No sale" You'll bring honor to us all [Make-Up Lady holds a mirror so Mulan can see her<sp>
</sp>

 reflection. Not looking pleased, Mulan takes her single, short bang and brings it down in front of<sp>
</sp>

 her forehead and smiles]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li [spoken. Fa Li places a hair comb in Mulan's hair]: There, you're ready.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa [spoken]: Not yet! An apple for serenity [putting an apple in Mulan's mouth]...A<sp>
</sp>

 pendant for balance [places a yin-yang pendant under her sash] [sings]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Beads of jade for beauty [putting beads around Mulan's neck] You must proudly show it [Grandma<sp>
</sp>

 Fa raises her chin high with her hand] Now add a cricket just for luck [putting the cage with<sp>
</sp>

 Cri-Kee under Mulan's sash in the back. Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased] And even you can't blow<sp>
</sp>

 it&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: [Walking to catch up with the other maidens] Ancestors Hear my plea Help me not to make<sp>
</sp>

 a fool of me And to not uproot my fam'ly tree Keep my father standing tall&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Maidens and Mulan: [Mulan taking the parasol from Fal Li and running to fall in line with the<sp>
</sp>

 other 4 maidens] Scarier than the undertaker We are meeting our matchmaker&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;All Townspeople: Destiny Guard our girls And our future as it fast unfurls Please look kindly<sp>
</sp>

 on these cultured pearls Each a perfect porcelain doll&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Maiden #1: Please bring honor to us Maiden #2: Please bring honor to us Maiden #3: Please bring<sp>
</sp>

 honor to us Maiden #4: Please bring honor to us Mulan and Maidens: Please bring honor to us all! &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[All Girls and Mulan arrive before the Matchmaker crouched down behind their parasols. End of<sp>
</sp>

 song]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Matchmaker [looking at her clipboard]: Fa Mulan&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [Jumping up and raising her hand]: Present.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Matchmaker: Speaking without permission.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Oops. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]: Who spit in her bean curd?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following behind and closing<sp>
</sp>

 the door]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Matchmaker [looking over Mulan]: Huh, Hmm, too skinny. [Cri-Kee escapes from his cage. Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons. [Mulan puts Cri-Kee in her mouth when<sp>
</sp>

 Matchmaker turns around to face her] Recite the final admonition.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [nodding and smiling]: Mmm-Hmm. [Takes out fan and covers her mouth as she spits out<sp>
</sp>

 Cri-Kee] Ptu&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Matchmaker: Well...&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [with dignity]: Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--[looking at her arm with smeared<sp>
</sp>

 writing] spectfully. Reflect before you snack [surprised, Mulan looks at her arm again] act. [now<sp>
</sp>

 rapidly] This shall bring you honor and glory. [Fanning herself rapidly and sighing in relief]<sp>
</sp>

 Huh.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Matchmaker [snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes not finding any.<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her. Matchmaker grabs Mulan's right arm pulling her<sp>
</sp>

 along while smearing the writing and leaving some ink on her hand] Hmmm, this way. Now, pour the<sp>
</sp>

 tea [Pushing a teapot towards Mulan]. To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a sense<sp>
</sp>

 of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth. Mulan staring at Matchmaker pours some tea<sp>
</sp>

 onto the table then notices her mistake and pours the tea into the cup] and refinement. You must<sp>
</sp>

 also be poised. [Mulan notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as Matchmaker takes the cup]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [quiet and timid]: Um, pardon me.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Matchmaker: And silent! [Matchmaker sniffs the tea]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [reaching and grabbing the teacup]: Could I just take that back...one moment.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[They struggle for the teacup and it turns over on Matchmaker and Cri-kee jumps down<sp>
</sp>

 matchmaker's dress]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Matchmaker: Why you clumsy--[Matchmaker feels Cri-Kee in her dress and dances around] Wooo,<sp>
</sp>

 woooo, wooooooo, [Matchmaker knocks over her pot of coals, and sits down on the coals. Matchmaker<sp>
</sp>

 jumps around screaming] Ahhhhhhhhhhh [Mulan grabs her fan and briskly fans the charred area on<sp>
</sp>

 Matchmaker's behind causing it to flame up. Mulan looks surprised about her mistake]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to outside Matchmakers building showing Grandma Fa with much noise coming from<sp>
</sp>

 Matchmaker's building]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]: I think it's going well, don't you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Matchmaker [running out of the building screaming]: Put it out! Put it out! Put it out! [Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 takes the teapot, throws the tea on Matchmaker and puts out the fire. She bows, hands the teapot<sp>
</sp>

 back to Matchmaker and covers her face as she walks toward Fa Li and Grandma Fa] [with anger] You<sp>
</sp>

 are a disgrace! [Matchmaker throws the teapot down smashing it to pieces] You may look like a<sp>
</sp>

 bride, but you will never bring your family honor!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The townsfolk who have gathered whisper and walk away]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan walking through the gate with her home leading khan. She looks sorrowful. Fa Zhou<sp>
</sp>

 sees his daughter and smiles. Mulan sees her father's smile. She covers her face with Khan's head<sp>
</sp>

 and leads him to the water trough]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Song: Reflection]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Look at me [looking at her reflection in the water trough] I will never pass for a<sp>
</sp>

 perfect bride [taking off her earrings and beads of jade] Or a perfect daughter [Mulan watches Fa<sp>
</sp>

 Li relating what happened at the Matchmaker's to Fa Zhou] Can it be I'm not meant to play this<sp>
</sp>

 part? [Mulan releases Cri-Kee back to the wild] Now I see That if I were to truly To be myself<sp>
</sp>

 [Mulan hops along the bridge railing] I would break my family's heart&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Who is that girl I see [Mulan looks into the pond and sees her own reflection] Staring straight<sp>
</sp>

 Back at me? [Mulan puts her hand on the Great Stone Dragon and looks toward the temple] Why is my<sp>
</sp>

 reflection someone I don't know? [Cri-Kee rowing across the pond on a lily pad] Somehow I cannot<sp>
</sp>

 hide [Mulan walking into the family temple] Who I am [Cri-Kee watches Mulan in the temple seeing<sp>
</sp>

 multiple reflections of herself in the ancestors' stones] Though I've tried [Mulan bows to the<sp>
</sp>

 ancestors] When will my reflection show Who I am inside? [Mulan finishes wiping off her make-up<sp>
</sp>

 seeing her reflection in the stones] When will my reflection show Who I am inside? [Mulan gets up<sp>
</sp>

 and heads out the temple]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[End of song. Mulan sits on a bench under the blossom tree. Fa Zhou approaches her, clearing<sp>
</sp>

 his throat. Mulan sees him approaching and turns her head away. Fa Zhou sits down beside<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: My, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year [looking up into the blossom tree].<sp>
</sp>

 But look, this one's late. But, I'll bet that when it blooms, it will be the most beautiful of<sp>
</sp>

 all. [Mulan and Fa Zhou share smiles. Drums start pounding announcing the arrival of Chi Fu and<sp>
</sp>

 two guards on horseback]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: What is it?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Fa Zhou gets up and walks to the entrance of their house with Mulan following]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li: Mulan, stay inside.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside. Mulan spies the<sp>
</sp>

 railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Citizens I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City: the Huns have invaded<sp>
</sp>

 China! &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Townspeople [expressing surprise]: No!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the Imperial Army. The<sp>
</sp>

 Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard and takes the conscription notice from<sp>
</sp>

 the guard]. The Yi family.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yi's Son [holding his old father back]: I will serve the Emperor in my father's place.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: The Fa Family.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: No.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu. Fa Zhou bows before the<sp>
</sp>

 horsemen]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou [standing proud]: I am ready to serve the Emperor. [Fa Zhou reaches for the<sp>
</sp>

 conscription notice]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription notice]: Father, you<sp>
</sp>

 can't go.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou [turning to see his daughter]: Mulan!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Please sir, my father has already fought bravely--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Silence! You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue in a man's<sp>
</sp>

 presence.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou [looking away from Mulan]: Mulan, you dishonor me.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Grandma Fa guides Mulan back away]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [handing Fa Zhou the conscription notice]: Report tomorrow at the Wu Shu camp.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: Yes, sir. [Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take his cane from Fa<sp>
</sp>

 Li]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [fading out as we follow Fa Zhou]: The Chu family. The Wen family. The Chang family.<sp>
</sp>

 The...&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Fa Zhou in his armory at night. Fa Zhou takes out his sword and practices his stances.<sp>
</sp>

 Whan he balances on his right leg, his leg injury acts up and he falls. Unbeknownst to her father,<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan watches in horror. She breathes heavily]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to dinner. The Fa Zhou, Grandma Fa, Fa Li, and Mulan eat in silence. Thunder can be heard<sp>
</sp>

 and lightning can be seen through the opaque window. Mulan pours the tea for her family. She slams<sp>
</sp>

 her teacup down on the table and stands up]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: You shouldn't have to go.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li: Mulan!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: There are plenty of young men to fight for China.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: It is an honor to protect my country and my family.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [angrily]: So you'll die for honor!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou [standing up and angered]: I will DIE doing what's right.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [starts to speak but is cut off]: But if you--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: I know my place, it is time you learned yours.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan looking like she's about to cry, turn away from Fa Zhou and runs outside into the rain<sp>
</sp>

 storm and cries]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan sitting at the base of the Great Stone Dragon in the rain. Mulan looks down to<sp>
</sp>

 see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She watches her parents in the bedroom. Fa Li<sp>
</sp>

 turns away from Fa Zhou and walks out of site. Fa Zhou blows out the light. Mulan gets up and<sp>
</sp>

 walks to the Fa Family Temple. Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights incense<sp>
</sp>

 and places it in the hanging encense holder. She bows and prays to her ancestors. Getting up,<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan hurries down the steps. Cri-Kee sees her and hops down from above and follows her. Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 goes to her parent's bedroom and takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her<sp>
</sp>

 mother gave to her. She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries out. Cut<sp>
</sp>

 to Mulan in the armory. She opens the cabinet with the armor. Using her father's sword, she cuts<sp>
</sp>

 her hair short and ties it up above her head. She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the<sp>
</sp>

 front. She takes the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left. Cut to Mulan in the stable<sp>
</sp>

 doorway. Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan. Mulan goes forward and comforts Khan<sp>
</sp>

 letting him know her identity. Mulan walks Khan out of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground<sp>
</sp>

 as she passes by. Mulan takes one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan<sp>
</sp>

 through the gate and off to camp.]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple. The eyes glow. Cut to Grandma Fa. She<sp>
</sp>

 wakes up with a start rising in bed. Cut to Grandma Fa walking into Fa Li and Fa Zhou's bedroom,<sp>
</sp>

 both are in bed]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa: Mulan is gone.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou [waking up]: What? It can't be. [Fa Zhou looks at his night stand and notices the hair<sp>
</sp>

 comb in place of his conscription notice. He checks the cabinet and sees his armor is gone. He<sp>
</sp>

 hurries outside] [calling out] Mulan! [He stumbles while walking because of his leg injury]<sp>
</sp>

 No.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li [kneeling down beside the fallen Fa Zhou]: You must go after her. She could be<sp>
</sp>

 killed!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou [sadly]: If I reveal her, she will be. [Fa Zhou embraces Fa Li]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa: Ancestors, hear our prayer: Watch over Mulan.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the Fa Family Temple. A wind blows out the incense at the base of the center stone. The<sp>
</sp>

 center stone begins to glow as First Ancestor comes to life]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [motioning to a bronze dragon]: Mushu, awaken!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mushu comes to life and falls to the ground flat on his back all being obscured by smoke]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [rising from the smoke arms stretched out]: I live! So tell me what mortal needs my<sp>
</sp>

 protection Great Ancestor. You just say the word and I'm there.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [agitated]: Mushu!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to threaten our family,<sp>
</sp>

 vengeance will be MINE. Hrrrrr.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [sternly to silence Mushu]: Mushu! These are the family guardians [motioning<sp>
</sp>

 towards the stone statues on pedestals near the ceiling]. They...&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [dejectedly]: Protect the family.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [pointing to the empty pedestal]: And you, oh demoted one.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: I...ring the gong.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor: That's right, now, wake up the ancestors.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: One family reunion coming right up. [ringing the gong] Okay people, people look alive,<sp>
</sp>

 lets go! C'mon get up. Let's move it, rise and shine. You're way past the beauty sleep thing now<sp>
</sp>

 trust me!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 1: I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the start.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 3: Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the family.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 2: She's just trying to help her father.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 4 [appearing out of thin air]: But, if she is discovered, Fa Zhou will be forever<sp>
</sp>

 shamed. Dishonor will come to the family. Traditional values will disintegrate.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 5: Not to mention they'll lose the farm.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 1: My children never caused such trouble. They all became acupuncturists.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 3: Well, We can't all be acupuncturists.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 6: No, your great granddaughter had to be cross-dresser!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[All ancestors argue at once, except First Ancestor]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 7: Let a guardian bring her back. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 8 [grabbing Mushu and bringing him next to a guardian]: Yeah, awaken the most<sp>
</sp>

 cunning.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 4 [taking Mushu and holding him next to the stone rabbit guardian]: No, the<sp>
</sp>

 swiftest.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 9 [grabbing Mushu and holding him next to the stone monkey guardian]: No, send the<sp>
</sp>

 wisest.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor: Silence! We must send the most powerful of all [Motioning to the Great Stone<sp>
</sp>

 Dragon as it is seen through the window]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [climbs up the empty guardian post laughing]: Ho, ho, heh, heh. Okay, okay, I get the<sp>
</sp>

 drift, I'll go. [All Ancestors give a quick look of surprise and laugh uncontrollably] You all<sp>
</sp>

 don't think I can do it. Watch this here. [Mushu produces a small flame from his mouth] Ah, ha,<sp>
</sp>

 Jump back, I'm pretty hot huh. Don't make me have to singe nobody to prove no point.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling away from the post]: You had your chance to protect<sp>
</sp>

 the Fa family.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 6: Your mis-guidance led Fa Deng to disaster.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Deng [with his decapitated head on his lap]: Yeah, thanks a lot.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: And your point is?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor: The point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: What? But I'm a real dragon.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling him away from the guardian post as Mushu fights to<sp>
</sp>

 hold on]: You are not worthy of this spot. Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon. [First Ancestor<sp>
</sp>

 throws Mushu out of the temple]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [looking back into the temple]: So you'll get back to me on the job thing.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[An ancestor throws Mushu's gong and hits Mushu in the face]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [walking with a slouch and banging the gong on the ground]: Just one chance is that too<sp>
</sp>

 much to ask? I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [rings the gong and looks at the Great Stone Dragon]: Yo rocky, wake up! You gotta go<sp>
</sp>

 fetch Mulan. [pauses as nothing happens. Mushu walks over to the side of the statue] C'mon boy, go<sp>
</sp>

 get her, go on, [throws the gong stick off the screen and whistles] Come on. [Angrily while<sp>
</sp>

 climbing up the Great Stone Dragon] Grrr, Grrrr. [speaking in his ear and banging the ear with the<sp>
</sp>

 gong] Hello, helloooooo. [curtly] Hello [bangs the gong extra hard against the ear causing it to<sp>
</sp>

 break off]. Uh oh. [The Great Stone Dragon crumbles to the ground, head intact minus the ear].<sp>
</sp>

 [knocks on the dragon's head] Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey. Oh man, they're gonna kill me!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [calling out through the temple window]: Great Stone Dragon, have you awaken? &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor can only see it's<sp>
</sp>

 head and Mushu's body]: Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up. And I am the Great Stone Dragon, good morning<sp>
</sp>

 [Mushu waves]. I will go forth and fetch Mulan. Did, did I mention that I was the Great Stone<sp>
</sp>

 Dragon?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor: Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face. [Mushu falls down the hill under the<sp>
</sp>

 weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the dragon's pedestal with the head falling<sp>
</sp>

 on top of him]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [muffled]: Ow, my elbow. Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. [Throwing the head off him]<sp>
</sp>

 That's just great. Now what? I'm doomed! And all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag<sp>
</sp>

 show on the road.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cri-Kee enters stage right]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Cri-Kee: Chirp, Chirp.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Go get her? What's the matter with you? After this great stone Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd<sp>
</sp>

 have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the temple. Wait a minute, that's it! I make<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan a war hero, then they'll be begging me to come back to work. That's the master plan. Oh,<sp>
</sp>

 you've gone and done it now. [Mushu runs off stage right]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Cri-Kee [hopping along side of Mushu]: Chirp. Chirp Chirp Chirp.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [pushing Cri-Kee away]: Hey, what makes you think you're coming?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Cri-Kee: Chirp, Chirp. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: You're lucky? Ho, ho, heh. Do I look like a sucker to you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Cri-Kee: Chirp. Chirp.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Whach' you mean loser? How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and throw it across the<sp>
</sp>

 yard. Then who's a loser, me or you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Interlude]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Shan-Yu leading his army at a charge on horseback through a forest. He stops and<sp>
</sp>

 motions stage right. Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair Guy dismount and walk into the<sp>
</sp>

 forest. They throw down two Imperial scouts before the rest of the army]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hun Long-Hair Guy: Imperial scouts. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan Yu dismounts and walks towards the scouts]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Scout #1: Shan-Yu.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[He crouches down in front of them]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [adjusting Scout #1's collar]: Nice work, gentlemen. You found the Hun army. [motioning<sp>
</sp>

 to the soldiers on horseback. The Hun army laughs]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Scout #2: The Emperor will stop you.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [grabs Scout #2 by the shirt collar and lifts him up to his face]: Stop me? He invited<sp>
</sp>

 me. By building his wall, he challenged my strength. Well I'm here to play his game [Shan-Yu<sp>
</sp>

 throws Scout #2 to the ground and points his sword at Scout #1 as he gets up and runs] [calling<sp>
</sp>

 out to the scouts] Go! Tell your emperor to send his strongest armies. [Quietly] I'm ready. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The Imperial Scouts run off towards the palace]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [scratching his chin]: How many men does it take to deliver a message.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Archer Guy [drawing back his bow]: One.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[End Interlude]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan on a hill outside of the camp. Khan is sitting watching]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Okay, okay, how 'bout this? Ahem, [in her manly voice] excuse me, where do I sign in?<sp>
</sp>

 Hah, I see you have a sword. I have one too. They're very manly and tough [Mulan bites her lip as<sp>
</sp>

 she mishandles pulling the sword out of the scabbard and it falls to the ground. Khan rolls on his<sp>
</sp>

 back in laughter. Mulan throws her shoe and hits Khan in the head with it quieting Khan]. I'm<sp>
</sp>

 working on it. Who am I fooling? It's going to take a miracle to get me into the army.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mushu appears as a giant shadow being cast on a rock with flames on either side. Mushu's real<sp>
</sp>

 appearance remains out of sight]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [in a Southern Baptist Preacher's voice]: Did I hear someone ask for a miracle!? Let me<sp>
</sp>

 hear you say aye!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [Running and hiding behind a rock]: Ahhhhhh.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: That's close enough.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [from behind a rock]: Ghost.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand. For I have been sent by your<sp>
</sp>

 ancestors-- [notices Cri-Kee making a hand shadow of a dragon on the rock and stamps him down with<sp>
</sp>

 his foot] to guide you through your masquerade. [bending down to Cri-Kee] C'mon, you're gonna stay<sp>
</sp>

 you're gonna work. [returning to Mulan] Heed my word, 'cause if the army finds out that you are a<sp>
</sp>

 girl, the penalty is death. [big flames shoot up from the rocks]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Who are you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Who am I? Who am I? I am the guardian of lost souls. [Mulan smiles big in anticipation<sp>
</sp>

 of seeing her guardian] I am the powerful, the pleasurable, the indestructible [coming out from<sp>
</sp>

 the rocks to show his real size] Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty hot, huh? [Khan stomps on Mushu. Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 pushes Khan back]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Hey, dragon, dragon, not lizard. I don't do that tongue thing [flips out his tongue to<sp>
</sp>

 show Mulan what he means].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: You're uh...&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Intimidating? Awe inspiring?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size]: Tiny.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [with a look of disappointment]: Of course. I'm travel size for your convenience. If I<sp>
</sp>

 was my real size, your cow here [patting Khan on the nose] would die of fright. [Khan tries to<sp>
</sp>

 bite Mushu] [pointing to the ground speaking to Khan] Down Bessy. My powers are beyond your mortal<sp>
</sp>

 imagination. For instance, [leaning in and looking at Mulan's chest] my eyes can see straight<sp>
</sp>

 through your armor. [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm and slaps Mushu with the right] Ow.<sp>
</sp>

 [angrily] All right, that's it! Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family. [aside to Cri-Kee] Make a<sp>
</sp>

 note of this [Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts writing]. [Loudly with gusto] Dishonor on<sp>
</sp>

 you. Dishonor on your cow. Dis-&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [pleadingly while covering Mushu's mouth]: Stop! I'm sorry, I'm sorry [kneeling down in<sp>
</sp>

 front of Mushu]. I'm just nervous. I've never done this before.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Then you're gonna have to trust me. And don't you slap me no more, we clear on that?<sp>
</sp>

 [Mulan nods emphatically]. All right. Okey dokey, let's get this show on the road. Cri-Kee, get<sp>
</sp>

 the bags [Mushu starts walking to the camp]. [to Khan] Let's move it heifer.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan at the camp's entrance]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [hiding in Mulan's armor poking his head out from her back]: Okay this is it, time to<sp>
</sp>

 show 'em your man walk. Shoulders back, chest high, feet apart, head up [Mushu pulls Mulan's head<sp>
</sp>

 back] ...and strut 2, 3, break it down, 2, 3 and work it, [Mulan walks into the camp drawing the<sp>
</sp>

 attention the men who see her. Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose and another<sp>
</sp>

 man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautiful isn't it?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [making a face of disgust and continuing to walk]: They're disgusting.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: No, they're men. And you're going to have to act just like them, so pay attention.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Tattoo Soldier [showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly]: Look, this tattoo will<sp>
</sp>

 protect me from harm.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causing Ling to laugh.<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan watches in utter amazement. Yao kisses his hand]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [laughing]: I hope you can get your money back.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: I don't think I can do this.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: It's all attitude. Be tough like this guy here [looking at Yao].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan looks at Yao as he hocks up a loogie and spits]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [noticing Mulan watching him]: What are you looking at?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.'&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the shoulder. The force causes Yao to<sp>
</sp>

 run into Chien-Po]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po: Oh Yao, you made a friend.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan slaps Yao on the behind]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: Wu hoo hooooo. [grabbing Mulan buy the collar] I'm going to hit you so hard it'll make<sp>
</sp>

 your ancestors dizzy.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po [Holding and picking up Yao]: Yao, relax and chant with me. Yaaaaaaa Moouuuu Ahhhhhh<sp>
</sp>

 Doooou Fuuuu Daaaaa.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: Ya Mi Ah To Fu Da.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po: Feel better? &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [relaxed]: Yeah. [Chien-Po places Yao back on the ground] [to Mulan while walking away]<sp>
</sp>

 Aaaaa, you ain't worth my time chicken boy.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [loudly]: Chicken boy!? Say that to my face ya limp noodle!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch. Mulan ducks as Yao hits Ling<sp>
</sp>

 standing behind her]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: Oh, sorry Ling. Hey!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away. Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to<sp>
</sp>

 land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of<sp>
</sp>

 Chien-Po]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling: You're dead. [They fight on top of Chien-Po. Mulan runs away. Ling notices Mulan and then<sp>
</sp>

 points toward her] Oh, there he goes.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan runs into a tent and stops. Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the<sp>
</sp>

 tent. Yao stops short as he is about to run into a soldier in a line for food. He looks behind him<sp>
</sp>

 with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time. Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line of<sp>
</sp>

 soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it. The men look to<sp>
</sp>

 the back of the line and spy Mulan who has emerged from the tent. They angrily start walking<sp>
</sp>

 towards her. Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Hey guys. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent. General Li and Li Shang are in the tent.]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;General Li [motioning with his pointer to a map of the region]: The Huns have struck here, here<sp>
</sp>

 and here. I will take the main troops up to the Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys<sp>
</sp>

 this village.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Excellent strategy, Sir. I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;General Li: You will stay here and train the new recruits. When Chi Fu believes you're ready,<sp>
</sp>

 you will join us...Captain. [General Li hands a sword to Shang]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Captain?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General. Uh, perhaps a soldier with more<sp>
</sp>

 experience--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;General Li: Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques, [leaning back<sp>
</sp>

 smugly stroking his chin] an impressive military lineage. I believe Li Shang will do an excellent<sp>
</sp>

 job.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [excitedly]: Oh, I will. I wont let you down. This is, I mean, I...[somberly] yes<sp>
</sp>

 sir.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;General Li [gets up and starts walking out of the tent]: Very good then. We'll toast China's<sp>
</sp>

 victory at the Imperial City. [to Chi Fu] I'll expect a full report in three weeks.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [to Shang]: And I wont leave anything out. [exits through the tent]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [while tying his sword to his uniform]: Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China's finest<sp>
</sp>

 troops. No, the greatest troops of all time. Heh, heh, heh, heh. [Shang walks out of the tent to<sp>
</sp>

 see the recruits fighting. He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li. Injured Recruit sees the<sp>
</sp>

 General and salutes him as he falls to the ground. General Li steps over Injured Recruit and<sp>
</sp>

 mounts his horse]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Most impressive.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;General Li: Good luck Captain. [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [quietly, to himself]: Good luck, Father. [Shang looks at his troops and sighs]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [smirking, with board and brush in hand]: Day one.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [shouting]: Soldiers!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;All Recruits [backing away revealing Mulan and pointing at her. Mulan is crouching in the fetal<sp>
</sp>

 position on the ground]: He started it!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang approaches Mulan and looks down over her. Mulan looks up, sees Shang over top of her and<sp>
</sp>

 gets up quickly dusting herself off]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [to Mulan]: I don't need anyone causing trouble in my camp!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Sorry, [in her man voice] Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that. [with her fist she<sp>
</sp>

 taps Shang on the shoulder] You know how it is when you get those, uh [pounding her chest] manly<sp>
</sp>

 urges and you just have to kill something [slapping her hand], fix things, uh, cook outdoors.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: What's your name?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [stumbling]: Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [stepping into Mulan's face]: Your commanding officer just asked you a question.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Uhh, I've got a name. Huh. And it's a boys name too.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [from the back of Mulan]: Ling, How 'bout Ling?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [to Mushu motioning with her head to Ling]: His name's Ling.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: I didn't ask for his name. I asked for yours.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Try, uh, ahh, Chu!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Ah Chu.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Ah Chu?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Gesundheit. He He, I kill myself.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [whispering over her shoulder]: Mushu.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Mushu?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: No.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Then what is it!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: It's Ping.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Ping.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Of course Ping DID steal my gir-[Mulan reaches back and grabs holds Mushu's mouth<sp>
</sp>

 together]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Yes, my name is Ping.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Let me see your conscription notice. [Takes the notice from Mulan] Fa Zhou, *the* Fa<sp>
</sp>

 Zhou?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Um, he...doesn't talk about me much. [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the<sp>
</sp>

 saliva just runs from her mouth. The recruits laugh]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [to the recruits]: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight<sp>
</sp>

 picking up every single grain of rice. And tomorrow, the real work begins.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[All recruits growl at Mulan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [Popping out the front of Mulan's armor]: You know, we have to work on your people<sp>
</sp>

 skills.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent. Mushu winds up Cri-Kee's wings. Cri-Kee rings like an alarm<sp>
</sp>

 clock]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty. [Mulan rises and blinks] C'mon [rapping on<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan's head with each syllable] hup, hup, hup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers<sp>
</sp>

 over her head. Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely] Get your clothes on. Get ready. Got<sp>
</sp>

 breakfast for ya. [Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee with a bowl of porridge] Look, you get porridge,<sp>
</sp>

 and it's happy to see you. [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley<sp>
</sp>

 face. Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] Hey, get outta there, you gonna make people<sp>
</sp>

 sick! [Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Am I late?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [while feeding Mulan]: No time to talk. Now remember, it's your first day of training so<sp>
</sp>

 listen to your teacher and no fighting. Play nice with the other kids, unless of course one of the<sp>
</sp>

 other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid's butt.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [with her mouth full of food]: But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Don't talk with your mouth full. Now let's see your war face [Mulan looks at him with<sp>
</sp>

 wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food]. I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover. C'mon<sp>
</sp>

 scare me, girl! &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [swallows the food]: Rrrrrrr!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [rolling back into the half eaten bowl of porridge]: Oh, that's my tough looking warrior.<sp>
</sp>

 That's what I'm talking about. Now get out there and make me proud. [Mushu ties up Mulan's<sp>
</sp>

 hair]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Khan whinnies and pokes his head into the tent]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: What do you mean the troops just left? &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [acting surprised]: They what!? [Mulan hurriedly puts on her clothes and jumps out of the<sp>
</sp>

 tent going off to join the other recruits] &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [running out from the tent calling after Mulan]: Wait, you forgot your sword. My little<sp>
</sp>

 baby off to destroy people [sniffle].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the troops muddling around near Shang's tent]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [enters stage left]: Order people, order!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Recruit #2: I'd like a pan fried noodle.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po: Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp [Ling and others begin to laugh]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Recruit #3: Moo goo gai pan&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: That's not funny.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan comes running up to the group]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [noticing Mulan's arrival]: Looks like our new friend slept in this morning. [Mulan stops<sp>
</sp>

 between Ling and Yao] [to Ping] Hellooo Ping, Are you hungry?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich. [grabs Mulan by the shirt collar drawing back<sp>
</sp>

 his other arm. Mulan hides her face with her hands. Ling looks away, closes his eyes, and puts his<sp>
</sp>

 fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;All Soldiers [in agreement with Yao]: Yeah.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [loudly]: Soldiers! [The soldiers line up quicky. Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a<sp>
</sp>

 bow and quiver of arrows. Mulan is duly impressed by Shang's physique] You will assemble swiftly<sp>
</sp>

 and silently every morning. [Shang walks down the line of soldiers] Anyone who acts otherwise will<sp>
</sp>

 answer to me.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: Ooooo, tough guy.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao]: Yao. [All recruits take a step<sp>
</sp>

 back leaving Yao one step forward. Shang Points arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high<sp>
</sp>

 pole] Thank you for volunteering. Retrieve the arrow.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [bows to Shang]: I'll get that arrow pretty boy. And I'll do it with my shirt on. [Yao<sp>
</sp>

 prepares to leap onto that pole]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: One moment, you seem to be missing something. [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.<sp>
</sp>

 Shang takes out one disk and holds it high speaking to all the troops] This represents discipline<sp>
</sp>

 [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's arm with it] and<sp>
</sp>

 this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground. The<sp>
</sp>

 troops laugh while Mulan looks concerned]. You need both to reach the arrow.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight. Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take<sp>
</sp>

 their turn and fall down. Mulan rubs her behind as she walks away in front of Shang]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: We've got a long way to go.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Song I'll Make a Man Out of You]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang throws staffs to the soldiers. Yao intercepts Mulan's staff and trips her with it]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Let's get down to business-- to defeat the Huns.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang throws up two clay pots and breaks them apart with his staff. The troops are highly<sp>
</sp>

 impressed]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Recruits [putting their staffs out at arms length, spoken]: Hua&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons? [Ling puts a cricket down Mulan's back<sp>
</sp>

 causing her to flail erratically] You're the saddest bunch I ever met [Most soldiers fall as Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 moves uncontrollably] But you can bet before we're through [Shang does a somersault in the air<sp>
</sp>

 landing near Mulan. He takes a pole in the stomach. Shang stops Mulan and takes her staff. He<sp>
</sp>

 grabs her by the collar] Mister, I'll make a man out of you &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang steps on a lever throwing up 3 targets which he hits with 3 arrows from one bow]<sp>
</sp>

 Tranquil as a forest [The recruits try and fail. Mulan gets ready to fire when Mushu sticks a<sp>
</sp>

 target on her arrow before she shoots. Mulan looks at Mushu's in shock and pauses. Shang looks<sp>
</sp>

 disdainfully at Mulan as she cracks a huge smile] But on fire within [Shang balances a bucket of<sp>
</sp>

 water on his head holding a staff. The recruits fire stones at him which Shang deflect with the<sp>
</sp>

 staff] Once you find your center You are sure to win [Mulan wobbles with the bucket of water on<sp>
</sp>

 her head. As the recruits throw stones at her the bucket tips over onto her head] You're a<sp>
</sp>

 spineless, pale, pathetic lot And you haven't got a clue [Shang throws his hand down into a river<sp>
</sp>

 and retrieves a fish. Mulan throws her hand down into the river and retrieve's Yao's foot. Mushu<sp>
</sp>

 comes out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan] Somehow I'll make a man out of<sp>
</sp>

 you!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po [running through a field of fire arrows]: I'm never gonna catch my breath&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [following Chien-Po, falls and gets hit in the butt with an arrow]: Say good-bye to those<sp>
</sp>

 who knew me&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [Banging his head on a stone slab]: Boy I was a fool in school for cutting gym&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang practices martial arts with Mulan. With a punch to the face he knocks her back into a<sp>
</sp>

 tree]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [from the tree acts as a boxing coach]: This guy's got 'em scared to death&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [Mushu pushes Mulan back out into the ring]: Hope he doesn't see right through me&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po [stops as he's hopping across poles protruding from water causing Shang and the<sp>
</sp>

 recruits to pile into him]: Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang and Chorus: [Cannon fire misses the target in the middle of an open field. Ling kicks the<sp>
</sp>

 support structure out from Mulan's cannon and it begins to fall. Mulan quickly grabs the cannon<sp>
</sp>

 and it fires high and back towards the camp landing and exploding Chi Fu's tent] (Be a man) We<sp>
</sp>

 must be swift as the coursing river (Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon (Be a man)<sp>
</sp>

 With all the strength of a raging fire [Picture of Shang looking over the camp from the hill not<sp>
</sp>

 looking pleased] Mysterious as the dark side of the moon &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [his troops laden with poles on their shoulders carrying bags of grain - one on each<sp>
</sp>

 side. They march up a mountain]: Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive [Chi Fu points<sp>
</sp>

 Shang's eyes back to a struggling Mulan who falls to the ground. Cri-Kee and Mushu try to pick her<sp>
</sp>

 up but hide when Shang comes up to her. Shang picks up her pole with grain, puts it on top of his<sp>
</sp>

 and returns to the troops. Mulan looks rejected] Heed my every order and you might survive [Shang<sp>
</sp>

 hand the reigns of Khan to Mulan] You're unsuited for the rage of war So pack up, go home, you're<sp>
</sp>

 through How could I make a man out of you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang and Chorus [Mulan takes the weights and tries to climb the pole again]: (Be a man) We<sp>
</sp>

 must be swift as the coursing river [Mulan ties the weights together behind the pole and uses the<sp>
</sp>

 cloth to help her shimmy up the pole] (Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon [As the sun<sp>
</sp>

 begins to rise the recruits come out of their tents to cheer on Mulan] (Be a man) With all the<sp>
</sp>

 strength of a raging fire [As Shang comes out of his tent, the arrow he shot up onto the pole<sp>
</sp>

 comes down to his feet. He looks up and sees Mulan sitting on top of the pole] Mysterious as the<sp>
</sp>

 dark side of the moon&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[order of events during the last repeat of the chorus: Troops hit all targets with arrows<sp>
</sp>

 correctly. Mulan racing in front of Shang and the recruits with the pole and weights on her<sp>
</sp>

 shoulders. Mulan kicking Shang in the face with a round house. Shang looking pleased. Chien-Po<sp>
</sp>

 doing acrobatics on the poles as the troops follow. Staffs being thrown to troops, Yao hands Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 hers. Yao running through arrows. Yao grabs Mulan's staff and hands it to her. Troop staff<sp>
</sp>

 practice #1. (Hya) Ling breaking the block Troop staff Practice #2. (Hya) Mulan holding up fish.<sp>
</sp>

 Troop staff practice #3. Cannon fire hitting the Hun Target. Troop staff practice #4 - jumping in<sp>
</sp>

 the air (Hya)] (Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing river (Be a man) With all the force of<sp>
</sp>

 a great typhoon (Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire Mysterious as the dark side of<sp>
</sp>

 the moon&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[End Song]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Interlude]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Shan Yu sitting on top of a tree. He cuts off the very top with his sword. His falcon<sp>
</sp>

 swoops buy and drops a doll. Shan-Yu takes the doll, sniffs it, looks surprised, and drops down to<sp>
</sp>

 the ground]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [tossing the doll to Hun Strong Man]: What do you see?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hun Strong Man [feeling the doll]: Black pine, from the high mountains. [Long Hair Hun Man<sp>
</sp>

 takes the doll from Hun Strong Man. Bald Hun Man #1 takes a hair as it passes by him]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Bald Hun Man #1: White horse hair. Imperial stallions. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Long Hair Hun Man [sniffing the doll]: Sulfur, from cannons.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu: This doll came from a village in the Tung Shao Pass, where the Imperial Army's waiting<sp>
</sp>

 for us.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hun Archer: We can avoid them easily.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [shaking his head]: No, the quickest way to the Emperor is through that pass. Besides,<sp>
</sp>

 the little girl will be missing her doll. We should return it to her.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[End Interlude]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan by the lake with Mushu, Khan, and Cri-Kee]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea. What if somebody sees you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [from behind the reeds]: Just because I look like a man doesn't mean I have to smell like<sp>
</sp>

 one. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [holding a towel covering his eyes with his ears]: So a couple of guys don't rinse out<sp>
</sp>

 their socks, picky, picky, picky. Well myself I kinda like that corn chip's smell.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [running by Mushu and jumps into the lake splashing water on Mushu]: Ahhhhhhh.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Okay, all right, all right, that's enough. Now, c'mon, get out before you get all pruny<sp>
</sp>

 and stuff [holding out a towel towards Mulan keeping his eyes covered].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Yeah, yeah, [walking in a womanly fashion speaking in woman's voice] stand watch Mushu<sp>
</sp>

 while I blow our secret with my stupid girly habits. [back to normal] Humph, hygiene.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Cri-Kee [alarmed, tugging on Mushu's whiskers]: Chirp, Chirp.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: Me first! Me first! Me First! [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po run by Mushu smacking him in the<sp>
</sp>

 face with colored boxers]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [gasps]: Ah. We're doomed! There a couple of things I know they're bound to notice!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Yao and Ling jump into the water. Chien-Po dips in his toe to check temperature then jumps in<sp>
</sp>

 causing a large wave. Yao and Ling ride the wave towards Mulan. Mulan sees them and hides her face<sp>
</sp>

 behind a lily pad]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [calling]: Hey, Ping.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan peeks over the lily pad and spreads it on the water covering her chest]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [speaking nervously and unnaturally in a manly voice]: Oh hi guys, I didn't know you were<sp>
</sp>

 *here*. [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po share "this boy is strange" looks] I was just washing, so now I'm<sp>
</sp>

 clean and I'm gonna go. Bye, bye. [Mulan hides behind a rock keeping her front facing the<sp>
</sp>

 rock]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [from behind Mulan]: Come back here. I know we were jerks to you before so lets start<sp>
</sp>

 over. [extending his hand to shake hands with Mulan] Hi, I'm Ling!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [covering her chest with her left arm, she turns and shakes his hand with an outstretched<sp>
</sp>

 right arm, smiling]: Heh, heh. [Mulan turns and wades away from Ling and runs into Chien-Po]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po [taking a lily pad off his head]: And I'm Chien-Po.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [waving slightly and smiling]: Hello Chien-Po.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Yao stands on top of a rock looking down at the others. Mulan looks down into the water and<sp>
</sp>

 hides her eyes with her free hand]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: And I am Yao, king of the rock. And there's nothin' you girls can do about it.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [taking a fighting stance]: Oh, yeah? Well, I think Ping [elbowing Mulan] and I could take<sp>
</sp>

 you.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [wading away]: I really don't want to take him anywhere.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [following Mulan]: Ping, we have to fight!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: No we don't. [unnaturally] We could just close our eyes and swim around.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling: C'mon don't be such a g--Ouch! Something bit me.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [popping out of the water between Mulan and Ling]: What a nasty flavor.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [with fear and gusto]: Snake! &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po [while all three of them climb up the rock and on each other]: Snake, snake.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan whistles for Khan and wades back to shore. Khan comes close enough to shore and Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 hides behind Khan as she wraps a towel around her body]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Yao, Ling and Chien-Po calmed down sitting on the rock]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling: Some king of the rock! [Yao pushes him off the rock]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan with towel wrapped around her]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Boy, that was close.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [brushing his teeth]: No, that was vile! You owe me big!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: I never want to see a naked man again. [the rest of the troops run by naked and jump<sp>
</sp>

 into the lake]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Hey, don't look at me. I ain't biting any more butts.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan outside Chi Fu's Tent having dressed fully. Chi Fu and Shang are talking from<sp>
</sp>

 inside]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [fading in]: You think your troops are ready to fight? Hah! They would not last a minute<sp>
</sp>

 against the Huns. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: They completed their training.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain. Once the<sp>
</sp>

 general reads my report, your troops will never see battle.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [from outside the tent]: Oh no you don't. I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war.<sp>
</sp>

 [to Cri-Kee] This guy's messing with my plan.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board]: We're not finished.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [pulling the board away]: Be careful, Captain. The General may be your father, but I am<sp>
</sp>

 the Emperor's council. And, oh, by the way, huh, I got that job on my own. [opens the entrance to<sp>
</sp>

 the tent for Shang] You're dismissed.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang storms out of the tent and starts to walk by Mulan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [in a manly voice]: Hey, I'll hold him and you punch, heh, heh... [Shang walks by without<sp>
</sp>

 reacting] or not. [calling out to Shang] For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain.<sp>
</sp>

 [Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [looking at Mulan's fixed gaze on Shang]: I saw that!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [innocently]: What?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [teasing]: You like him don't you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: No, I--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Yeah right, Yeah sure. Look, [pointing to Mulan's tent] go to your tent. [Mulan walks<sp>
</sp>

 away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to Cri-Kee] I think it's time we took this war into our<sp>
</sp>

 own hands [rubbing hands together].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent. Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and<sp>
</sp>

 wrapped in a towel and with big showering slippers on his feet. He whistles as he walks off. Mushu<sp>
</sp>

 and Cri-Kee enter his tent. Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter. He finishes and Mushu<sp>
</sp>

 takes the paper]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Okay, okay, let me see what you've got. From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the<sp>
</sp>

 huns at the pass and it would mean a lot if you'd come and back us up. [sarcastically] That's<sp>
</sp>

 great except you forgot, "and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't mind bringing<sp>
</sp>

 up some." Hellooooo, this is the army! Make it sound more urgent, please! You know what I'm<sp>
</sp>

 talkin' about? [Cri-Kee starts writing the note again] That's better, much better. [taking the<sp>
</sp>

 note] Okay, Let's go.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Khan drinking water from the trough. Mushu is on his back]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Khan-ie baby, hey, we need a ride. [Khan squirts Mushu off his back with water from his<sp>
</sp>

 mouth]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Chi Fu walking out of the lake wrapped in a towel, sounds of laughter can be heart from<sp>
</sp>

 the troops]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [muttering]: Insubordinate ruffians. [then calling to the troops] You men owe me a new<sp>
</sp>

 pair of slippers. And I do not squeal like a girl. [a panda bear chomps down on the slipper Chi Fu<sp>
</sp>

 is holding] Aaaaaahhhhhh!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [sitting on top of the panda bear behind a dummy of a soldier using sticks to gesticulate<sp>
</sp>

 with the dummy's arms to push the note towards Chi Fu. Cri-Kee works the mouth]: Urgent news from<sp>
</sp>

 the general! [Chi Fu looks over the panda] What's the matter, you've never seen a 'black and<sp>
</sp>

 white' before?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Who are you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Excuse me! I think the question is: who are you? We're in a war man! There's no time for<sp>
</sp>

 stupid questions. I should have your hat for that, [the panda starts walking forward] snatch it<sp>
</sp>

 right off of your head [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat. Mushu turns the upper half of the<sp>
</sp>

 dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu. Chi Fu begins reading the message]. But I'm feeling<sp>
</sp>

 gracious today, so carry on before I report you. [the panda walks up a tree taking Mushu and<sp>
</sp>

 Cri-Kee with him out of sight]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [looking around for Mushu but not finding him, then runs into Shang's tent]: Captain.<sp>
</sp>

 Urgent news from the General. We're needed at the front.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [from up in the tree]: Pack your bags Cri-Kee, we're movin' out. [Cri-Kee high fives<sp>
</sp>

 Mushu]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Song: A Girl Worth Fighting For]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Army Chorus [troops walking up hill]: For a long time we've been marching off to battle&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [close-up of Yao, then a shot of 2 cows]: In a thundering herd we feel a lot like<sp>
</sp>

 cattle&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Cow [spoken]: Moo&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Army Chorus [showing troops marching]: Like the pounding beat our aching feet aren't easy to<sp>
</sp>

 ignore&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [catching up to Yao and Chien-Po]: Hey, think of instead, A girl worth fighting for [Yao,<sp>
</sp>

 Ling and Chien-Po look upwards dreamily]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [spoken from behind]: Huh?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [grabbing Mulan and drawing her close while pulling out a centerfold]: That's what I said,<sp>
</sp>

 a girl worth fighting for [Mulan runs away seeing the centerfold]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[artistry section where the images are drawn like painted people. Ling is seen looking at a<sp>
</sp>

 woman and then kissing her] I want her paler than the moon with eyes that shine like stars&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [lifting and lowering a woman over his head then opening his chest to show a gaping wound<sp>
</sp>

 that we can see the woman through]: My girl will marvel at my strength, adore my battle scars&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po [Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the edge of a large bowl of rice as a<sp>
</sp>

 cow, pig and chicken fall beside them]: I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks<sp>
</sp>

 like It all depends on what she cooks like: Beef, pork, chicken... [end painted people section,<sp>
</sp>

 the last image fades into statues that the troops just passed]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;All Three: Mmm...&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [looking at Mulan while crossing the river with swords over their heads. Mulan looks<sp>
</sp>

 disgusted and hurries forward]: Bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [with armor full of water to make him look muscular]: And I'll bet the ladies love a man<sp>
</sp>

 in armor [the water leaks out making Ling look like his normal self]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Army Chorus [Mushu whistles to ladies working in the rice field from out of the carriage<sp>
</sp>

 holding cannons. Cri-Kee looks shocked. The ladies look and giggle at Mulan who hides her face]:<sp>
</sp>

 You can guess what we have missed the most since we went off to war What do we want? A girl worth<sp>
</sp>

 fighting for!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [Mulan walks away from Yao and into Chien-Po]: My girl will think I have no faults&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po: That I'm a major find&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [Caught between Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po who all look up dreamily waiting for her ideal<sp>
</sp>

 woman. She is forced to speak (sing)]: [spoken] Uh, [singing] How about a girl who's got a brain,<sp>
</sp>

 [Yao starts to look unimpressed] Who always speaks her mind? [Mulan shrugs her shoulders]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling, Yao and Chien-Po [disdainfully, looking disappointed and disgusted]: Nah!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [grabbing Mulan's shoulder and leaning on her, she takes his hand off and shakes her head<sp>
</sp>

 disapprovingly. Ling leans against the carriage of cannons]: My manly ways and turns of phrase are<sp>
</sp>

 sure to thrill her&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling. Ling looks upset then falls in<sp>
</sp>

 the mud]: He thinks he's such a lady-killer!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: I've a girl back home who's unlike any other.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [aside to Mulan]: Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his mother! [Mulan smiles]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Army Men [lining up locking arms across each others shoulders with Mulan in the middle to her<sp>
</sp>

 discontent]: But when we come home in victory they'll line up at the door!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [sitting on top of Chien-Po]: What do we want?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Army Chorus: A girl worth fighting for!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling: Wish that I had&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Army Chorus [Mulan breaks away and walks in the opposite direction of the army]: A girl worth<sp>
</sp>

 fighting for! (whistle) [Mulan sees Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po with snowballs about to pelt her so<sp>
</sp>

 she turns around] A girl worth fighting--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[All have stunned looks on their faces]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[End Song]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to ruins of a burned out village. The soldiers walk through the singed gate and look<sp>
</sp>

 around at the few planks that remain from the buildings]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [from mounted horse]: Search for survivors.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan walking around the burned-out village. She finds a the doll that Shan-Yu was<sp>
</sp>

 holding and looks up sorrowfully. Shang comes to her side]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: I don't understand. My father should have been here.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [calling out from the top of a hill overlooking a valley]: Captain! &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Chi Fu points down to the valley where the remains of General Li's army can be seen. Flags<sp>
</sp>

 poking up out of the snow, armor lying face down, broken cannon carts. Ling, Yao, Mulan, and a<sp>
</sp>

 soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley. Chien-Po walks up<sp>
</sp>

 from the valley carrying a helmet]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-po [handing the helmet to Shang]: ...the General.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill. He draws his sword and stabs it into<sp>
</sp>

 the snow upright. He kneels down and places the helmet on top of the sword. Mulan approaches him<sp>
</sp>

 from behind]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [softly]: I'm sorry.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang gets up, turns around and puts his hand on Mulan's shoulder and he walks by. Shang walks<sp>
</sp>

 to the center of the troops. He grabs his horse by the saddle, takes one quick look of grief then<sp>
</sp>

 mounts his horse]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: The Huns are moving quickly. We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the<sp>
</sp>

 Tung Shao Pass. We're the only hope for the Emperor now. Move out!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of the<sp>
</sp>

 sword. She turns around and joins the rest of the troops marching on]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons. A cannon blast shoots out<sp>
</sp>

 of the cart and explodes in the air. The troops look surprised. Mulan glances back with a scowl<sp>
</sp>

 into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face. Mushu points at<sp>
</sp>

 Cri-Kee. Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [angrily]: What happened?!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [stumbling]: Uhhh--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: You just gave away our position. Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he<sp>
</sp>

 falls to the ground. Shang pulls out the arrow] [calling out] Get out of range!!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them. Mulan pulls Khan<sp>
</sp>

 by the reins to hurry him up. Fire arrows start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.<sp>
</sp>

 The cart begins to blaze with fire]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Save the cannons!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one<sp>
</sp>

 while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him from bolting. Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.<sp>
</sp>

 The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan free from the cart. She<sp>
</sp>

 mounts Khan and charges away from the fire. The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing<sp>
</sp>

 her helmet and sword which land near her. Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and<sp>
</sp>

 land near Mulan.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Oh sure, save the horse.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops<sp>
</sp>

 position. Cri-Kee and Khan follow. Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against<sp>
</sp>

 rocks. They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Fire!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed. As the cannon fire<sp>
</sp>

 explodes, Shan-Yu's army hides]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Fire!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are<sp>
</sp>

 stationed. No more arrows can be seen coming from the mountain position]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Hold the last cannon. [Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses. Shan-Yu and his troops<sp>
</sp>

 appear at the top of the mountain] Prepare to fight. If we die, we die with honor.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's<sp>
</sp>

 position. His falcon flies off his shoulder on Shan-Yu's war cry The Hun army follows]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords. Mulan looks down at her<sp>
</sp>

 sword and sees the reflection of a large snow embankment hanging to the side of a cliff. She<sp>
</sp>

 rushes forward]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]: Hey. Shang: Ping, come back.<sp>
</sp>

 Ping!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his<sp>
</sp>

 falcon. Mushu looks over her at the oncoming horde with worry in his eyes]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [starting to run after her waving his arms]: Stop!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [seeing Shan-Yu riding closer to their position]: All right, you might want to light that<sp>
</sp>

 right about now. Quickly! Quickly!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse. Shan-Yu's falcon swoops buy knocking<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan down scattering the flint rock]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [speaking to Ling and Chien-Po]: C'mon, we've gotta help. [they charge towards Mulan's<sp>
</sp>

 position]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain. She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him<sp>
</sp>

 causing him to light the fuse. Mushu lands on the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the<sp>
</sp>

 charging Shan-Yu]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment]: You missed him! How<sp>
</sp>

 could you miss? He was three feet in front of you!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche. Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 looks up with an evil grin on her face and Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin<sp>
</sp>

 to be swallowed up by the snow]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan]: Yrrrrrrraah. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side. Mulan falls back<sp>
</sp>

 grabbing her right side. Shan-Yu's horse stumbles. Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the<sp>
</sp>

 avalanche. Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his horse.<sp>
</sp>

 Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him. Mulan grabs Shang as she<sp>
</sp>

 passes by him, turning him around and helping him run away from the avalanche]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao, Chien-Po and Ling [running towards the oncoming avalanche]: Yeeahhhhhh! [they stop.<sp>
</sp>

 noticing the oncoming avalanche they turn around and run back to where they came from]<sp>
</sp>

 Waaaaaaaaaa!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and<sp>
</sp>

 Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up Shan-Yu and his horse. Khan arrives at Mulan's position just<sp>
</sp>

 ahead of the avalanche. Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang. She grabs his hand, then the<sp>
</sp>

 avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of<sp>
</sp>

 snow]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock. They see the snow approaching close and<sp>
</sp>

 run to larger shelter where the rest of Shang's army is positioned just as the avalance reaches<sp>
</sp>

 their posision]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mushu riding down the snow on a shield]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [calling out]: Mulan! Mulan! [seeing hair sticking up from the snow] Mulan? [Mushu picks<sp>
</sp>

 up the Hun by the hair]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hun Soldier: Arrrrr.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [pushing the hun soldier back under the snow]: Nope. Mulan! [Mushu picks up Cri-Kee out<sp>
</sp>

 of the snow] Man, you are one lucky bug.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche. Khan and Mulan are<sp>
</sp>

 swept under by the snow and reemerge quickly. She looks back and sees Shang passed out riding the<sp>
</sp>

 wave of snow]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [calling loudly]: Shang, Shang! [Mulan turns around and rides to Shang's position. She<sp>
</sp>

 picks him up and places him on Khan. She turns Khan around again to be riding upstream]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Chien-Po with Ling standing on him and Yao standing on top of Ling]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po: Do you see them?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [extatically]: Yes! [Yao shoots an arrow with a rope attached] Perfect! Now I'll pull them<sp>
</sp>

 to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope completely passed through his hands]--ty.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the noise of the<sp>
</sp>

 avalanche]: Hey Mulan, I found a lucky cricket.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [speaking loudly]: We need help! [Yao's arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and<sp>
</sp>

 starts to tie the rope to Khan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]: Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit<sp>
</sp>

 by me. [Mushu sees that they're about to fall over the cliff. He and Cri-Kee look frightened]<sp>
</sp>

 Ahhhhh! We're gonna die! We're gonna die! I know we're gonna die! No way we can survive this!<sp>
</sp>

 Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [crying]: I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands. He grabs<sp>
</sp>

 on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff<sp>
</sp>

 edge with the rope taught over the cliff]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: Pull&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers. He lifts them all up and pulls<sp>
</sp>

 backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu and Cri-Kee to safety]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: I knew we could to it. You da man. [Mulan looks pleased] Well sorta. [Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 grimaces]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The soldiers help them up to the cliff]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling: Step back guys, give 'em some air.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [catching his breath]: Ping, you are the craziest man I've ever met. And for that I owe<sp>
</sp>

 you my life. From now on, you have my trust. [Mulan smiles big]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling: Let's hear it for Ping! The bravest of us all.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [lifting his arm high]: You're king of the mountain!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po [jumping up and down]: Yes, yes, yes!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [beginning to stand up]: Ahhh, [she clutches her right side]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Ping, what's wrong? [Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the blood on her hand and<sp>
</sp>

 seeping through the armour] [loudly] He's wounded, get help! [Ping starts to pass out. The images<sp>
</sp>

 of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses consciousness] Ping, hold on. Hold<sp>
</sp>

 on.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to outside of the medic tent. Mulan and Medic are inside. Shang stands by the entrance.<sp>
</sp>

 Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite concerned. Ling drums his fingers on his knees. The medic comes<sp>
</sp>

 out from the tent and whispers to Shang. Shang looks astonished and goes into the tent. Mulan is<sp>
</sp>

 lying down. She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him. She sits up allowing<sp>
</sp>

 the blanket to fall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest. She sees<sp>
</sp>

 Shang's surprised look and realizes her feminine form is noticeable]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [gasping as she covers up]: Huh, I can explain.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [stepping into the tent]: Huh? So it's true.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [calling after Shang as he steps out of the tent]: Shang!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to outside the tent. Chi Fu hauls out Mulan by the arm. Mulan uses her other hand to hold<sp>
</sp>

 the blanket]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: I knew there was something wrong with you. [Chi Fu takes off Mulan's hair tie and<sp>
</sp>

 throws her to the ground] A woman.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Ling, Yao and Chien-Po are shocked]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [to the troops]: Trecherous snake.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [on the ground kneeling and hunched over, speaking to Shang]: My name is Mulan. I did it<sp>
</sp>

 to save my father.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [to the troops]: High treason!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: I didn't mean for it to go this far.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [getting in Mulan's face and speaking to her while she whinces]: Ultimate dishonor.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: It was the only way. Please believe me.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [to Shang]: Hmph, Captain?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang walks over to Khan and takes the sword out of the scabbard attached to Khan. Khan rears<sp>
</sp>

 back]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [to the soldier by Khan]: Restrain him.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang walks toward Mulan with sword in hand]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao, Ling and Chien-Po [rushing toward Mulan]: Noooooo!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from proceeding further]: You know the<sp>
</sp>

 law.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang stands over Mulan. Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation. Shang lifts<sp>
</sp>

 the sword high above his head and throws it down in front of Mulan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: A life for a life. My debt is repaid. [turns and walks towards the Imperial City] Move<sp>
</sp>

 out!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [coming up to Shang's face]: But you can't just...&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [getting in Chi Fu's face]: I said, "Move out!"&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and<sp>
</sp>

 Mushu. Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his<sp>
</sp>

 mouth and sits behind her. Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs. When he doesn't get warm, he moves<sp>
</sp>

 under the blanket wrapped around Mulan. Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an<sp>
</sp>

 entourage. Man, all my fine work, ffft. [Mushu picks up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in<sp>
</sp>

 front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up]<sp>
</sp>

 Hi.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [look of sadness]: I should never have left home.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life. Who knew you'd end up shaming him,<sp>
</sp>

 disgracing your ancestors, and losing all your friends. You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn<sp>
</sp>

 to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Maybe I didn't go for my father. Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do<sp>
</sp>

 things right. So when I looked in the mirror [picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection<sp>
</sp>

 in her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile. But I was wrong. I see nothing. [throws the helmet down<sp>
</sp>

 and a tear runs down her cheek]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]: Well that's because this just needs a little<sp>
</sp>

 spit, that's all. Let me shine this up for ya [wiping the spit to clean the helmet and holding it<sp>
</sp>

 up to Mulan]. I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty. [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by<sp>
</sp>

 his actions, he shows sorrow on his face] The truth is we're both frauds. Your ancestors never<sp>
</sp>

 sent me, they don't even like me. I mean, you risked your life to help people you love. I risked<sp>
</sp>

 your life to help myself. At least you had good intentions [Mulan smiles].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Cri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]: Chirp, Chirp, Chirp. Bawl, Bawl.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: What!? What do you mean you're not lucky? You lied to me? [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan] And<sp>
</sp>

 what are you? A sheep?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [sadly]: I'll have to face my father sooner or later. Let's go home.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty. But, don't you worry, 'kay? Things'll work out. We<sp>
</sp>

 started this thing together and that's how we'll finish. [Mushu hugs Mulan. Mulan smiles] I<sp>
</sp>

 promise.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site. Shan-Yu's hand pops out of the snow.<sp>
</sp>

 He gets up and glances around]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [screaming]: Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Hun Archer, Long-Hair Hun Man, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Bald Man #1, and Hun Bald Man #2 each pop<sp>
</sp>

 out of the snow and join Shan-Yu. They set off towards the Imperial City]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [seeing them from behind, gasps]: Huh. [Mulan runs, grabs her sword, mounts Khan, and<sp>
</sp>

 heads out following the Huns to the Imperial City]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Home is that way! [points to the opposite direction Mulan is heading]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: I have to do something.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Did you see those Huns!? They popped out of the snow, like daisies!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Are we in this together or not?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Cri-Kee [emphatically]: Chirp, Chirp.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Well, let's go kick some Huny buns! [Jumps onto Khan and utters fighting words as they<sp>
</sp>

 ride off to the Imperial City] Wu Hu Ha Ga, Wu Hu Ha Ga&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the victory parade in the Imperial City. Fireworks go off, kites are flying. The<sp>
</sp>

 drummers march by, followed by the flutist, followed by the acrobats. The Parade Leader follows,<sp>
</sp>

 then Shang and his men, followed by lion dancers]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Parade Leader: Make way for the heros of China.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang leads the men on horseback, all have sorrowful looks on their faces. Mulan rides up<sp>
</sp>

 through the crowd and stops. She looks around and sees Shang in the parade]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [calling out]: Shang! [riding next to him]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [surprised]: Mulan?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: The Huns are alive, they're in the city.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: You don't belong here Mulan, go home.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [with a scowl rides khan to the other side of Shang]: Shang, I saw them in the mountains.<sp>
</sp>

 You have to believe me.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Why should I?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [riding ahead to block Shang's horse]: Why else would I come back? You said you'd trust<sp>
</sp>

 Ping. Why is Mulan any different?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]: Keep your eyes open. I know they're here. Hya.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she dismounts Khan and runs into<sp>
</sp>

 the palace yard]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Now where are you going?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [calling over her shoulder]: To find someone who will believe me. [Mulan runs into the<sp>
</sp>

 palace yard] &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace. Chi<sp>
</sp>

 Fu stands next to Shang and gives him Shan-Yu's sword. The Lion dancers stop behind Shang. A<sp>
</sp>

 palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom. China will sleep safely<sp>
</sp>

 tonight thanks to our brave warriors.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The crowd cheers]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder]: Sir, the Emperor's in danger! [Man<sp>
</sp>

 #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's touch and moves away] [agitated] But the Huns are here!<sp>
</sp>

 [Mulan walks up to Man #2] Please, you have to help me. [Man #2 walks away from Mulan] [turning to<sp>
</sp>

 Mushu who is standing near her in the yard] No one will listen!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [irritatedly]: Mushu!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Hey, you're a girl again, remember?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor]: Your Majesty, I present to you the sword<sp>
</sp>

 of Shan-Yu.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: I know what this means to you, Captain Li. Your father would have been very<sp>
</sp>

 proud.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor. The<sp>
</sp>

 falcon rises above the roof and drops the sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles<sp>
</sp>

 in the shadows blending in. He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that all the people<sp>
</sp>

 can see his face. The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu. Shang begins to draw his<sp>
</sp>

 sword. All 5 of Shan-Yu's men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the<sp>
</sp>

 Emperor knocking off his hat. Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry the Emperor into the Palace.<sp>
</sp>

 Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow<sp>
</sp>

 retreating into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [getting up and running toward the closing doors]: No.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [beckoning to the other soldiers]: C'mon.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang reaches the palace doors just as they close with all the Huns inside]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [laughs evily]: Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it as a battering ram. They are<sp>
</sp>

 unsuccessful at opening the door. Mulan sees what's going on and arrives at the steps]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [to herself]: They'll never reach the Emperor in time. [She looks at the columns and runs<sp>
</sp>

 near to the Shang and his soldiers. She whistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention] Hey<sp>
</sp>

 guys, I've got an idea. [Mulan runs around the palace to the right towards the columns]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Song: I'll Make a Man Out of You (reprise) plays in the background during the next action<sp>
</sp>

 sequence]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;(Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing river (Be a man) With all the force of a great<sp>
</sp>

 typhoon (Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire Mysterious as the dark side of the<sp>
</sp>

 moon&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan. Shang looks<sp>
</sp>

 astonished. Around the corner Yao, Ling and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as<sp>
</sp>

 women. Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and prepare to shimmy up<sp>
</sp>

 the columns. Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder. He takes off his cape and wraps it<sp>
</sp>

 around the column to signify that he's coming along. They shimmy up the poles together]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[End song]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 arriving with the Emperor and a high balcony within the palace.<sp>
</sp>

 Shan-Yu drops down from the roof]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu: Boo. [Shan-Yu steps into the balcony next to the Emperor] [to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2]<sp>
</sp>

 Guard the door [they walk off down the stairs that lead to the balcony]. [pacing around the<sp>
</sp>

 Emperor] Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn. Bow to me.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to the entrance to the stairwell that leads to the balcony. Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 come<sp>
</sp>

 down the stairs and close the door, joining Hun Archer Man, Hun Strong Man and Hun Long-Hair Man.<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan and company are around the corner]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [whispering]: Okay, any questions?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [whispering]: Does this dress make me look fat? [Mulan slaps him] Ow.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and trying to act lady-like including<sp>
</sp>

 holding fans and waving fans]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hun Archer: Who's there?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hun Bald Man #2 [putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword]: Concubines.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Hun Bald Man #1: Ugly concubines.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ling [waving daintily, speaking to Yao]: Oh he's so cute.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back. Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2. A bitten apple<sp>
</sp>

 falls out from beneath Ling's dress. He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss<sp>
</sp>

 of figure]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [from around the corner putting his head down into his hand]: Aww.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk. Mushu from above singes off all his feathers<sp>
</sp>

 with his fire breathing]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [to Cri-Kee sitting above him]: Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque. [Cri-Kee rolls<sp>
</sp>

 on his back in laughter. The stunned falcon doesn't do anything]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling. Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull<sp>
</sp>

 out the fruit they were using to simulate a woman's chest. Chien-Po takes his watermelons and<sp>
</sp>

 smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2. He then smashes their two heads together and<sp>
</sp>

 they fall to the ground. Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the<sp>
</sp>

 stomach causing Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground. Ling uses his head to crack Hun<sp>
</sp>

 Long-Hair Man's back. Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist at Yao and misses, he misses with the other.<sp>
</sp>

 Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away Hun Archer Man's<sp>
</sp>

 bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer. She follows with a<sp>
</sp>

 left elbow to the stomach followed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground. She sits<sp>
</sp>

 on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [calling out]: Shang, GO!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang runs out from behind the corner, charges through the door and runs up the stairs]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Shan-Yu and the Emperor on the balcony]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu: I tire of your arrogance old man. [yelling and putting his sword at the emperor's<sp>
</sp>

 throat] Bow to me!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu: Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shan-Yu draws back his sword to strike the<sp>
</sp>

 Emperor]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword. Shang swipes with<sp>
</sp>

 his sword. Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge. Shang grabs onto a column<sp>
</sp>

 and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu falls to<sp>
</sp>

 the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over forcing<sp>
</sp>

 Shang to be on his back underneath him. Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind as he uses<sp>
</sp>

 his hand to hit him in the head. Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm pulling it<sp>
</sp>

 behind Shan-Yu's back. Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the stairs]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Chien-Po, get the Emperor.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chien-Po [standing in front of the Emperor and bowing]: Sorry, your Majesty. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column in<sp>
</sp>

 the balcony. Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground. Shan Yu<sp>
</sp>

 watches the Emperor leave]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu: No! &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt; [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face. Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang<sp>
</sp>

 and throws him to the ground. Shang lies limp. Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the<sp>
</sp>

 edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground. Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao [motioning her to follow]: Come on!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look. Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the rope.<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 grabs Shan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope. Shan-Yu reaches the edge and grabs for the falling<sp>
</sp>

 rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves the sword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position.<sp>
</sp>

 The crowd cheers]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu: No! [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among the<sp>
</sp>

 throng of people] Yrraaaaahhhh!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang. Shan-Yu pulls<sp>
</sp>

 out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them. As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, he<sp>
</sp>

 puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife. Mulan slides away.<sp>
</sp>

 Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the<sp>
</sp>

 shirt collar]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [in Shang's face]: You, you took away my victory.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan's shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her feet. Shan-Yu turns toward<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: No! I did! [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she was a soldier]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu [looking at Mulan]: The soldier from the mountains.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs<sp>
</sp>

 and through the doors to the balcony. She closes the door with the latch falling in place right<sp>
</sp>

 behind her. She leans against the doors. Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist. Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 runs away from the doors down the corridor. Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horse catches up<sp>
</sp>

 with Mulan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: So what's the plan?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Ummmm.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: You don't have a plan?!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Hey, I'm making this up as I...[looks out a window and spies the firework tower] go.<sp>
</sp>

 Mushu--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: I'm way ahead of you sister. C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use<sp>
</sp>

 the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Shan-Yu. Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword<sp>
</sp>

 wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe. Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. Mulan<sp>
</sp>

 climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach. Shan-Yu slices the base of the column causing it<sp>
</sp>

 to fall and break through the outer wall. Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes to a stop.<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning. She looks off to her right and<sp>
</sp>

 spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Zoom in on the fireworks tower. Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework<sp>
</sp>

 lighters) on the edge of the tower] &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Citizens, I need firepower.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Barry Cook: Who are you?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]: You're<sp>
</sp>

 worst nightmare.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Man in Crowd #1: On the roof.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Man in Crowd #2: Look!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way. Shan-Yu breaks<sp>
</sp>

 through the roof behind Mulan surprising her. Mulan backs away and searches for something on her<sp>
</sp>

 person to help her against Shan-Yu. She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shan-Yu: It looks like you're out of ideas.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword. Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through<sp>
</sp>

 the fan. She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that<sp>
</sp>

 Shan-Yu loses his grip. The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping off<sp>
</sp>

 the fan with her sword movement]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Not quite. [calling out] Ready, Mushu?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]: I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a<sp>
</sp>

 stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework] Light me! [Cri-Kee lights the<sp>
</sp>

 fuse]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan. Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in<sp>
</sp>

 the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground. Mulan picks the sword back up and stabs<sp>
</sp>

 it into Shan-Yu's cape. The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu. Mulan lies flat<sp>
</sp>

 down on the left side of the roof. Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to run, but the<sp>
</sp>

 sword has him pinned to the spot. The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly propelling him<sp>
</sp>

 toward the firework tower. Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the rocket do the<sp>
</sp>

 work. Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail. Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the roof and runs away<sp>
</sp>

 from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [while running]: Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks<sp>
</sp>

 to fly everywhere. Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof. Propelled by the explosion, she grabs<sp>
</sp>

 onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down. She looks down and<sp>
</sp>

 releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the<sp>
</sp>

 ground. Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]:<sp>
</sp>

 Ah ha ha ha ha. [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to<sp>
</sp>

 Cri-Kee] You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]: That was a<sp>
</sp>

 deliberate attempt on my life. Where is she? Now she's done it. What a mess. [Shang and troops<sp>
</sp>

 push Mulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature's not worth<sp>
</sp>

 protecting.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [in Chi Fu's face]: She's a hero.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: 'Tis a woman. She will never be worth anything.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]: Listen, you pompous--&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor [walking down the steps]: That is enough!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Your Majesty, I can explain.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside. Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a<sp>
</sp>

 clear path to Mulan. Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor. Chi Fu with a sinister look<sp>
</sp>

 waits to write down the words of the Emperor]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan. You stole your father's armor, ran away<sp>
</sp>

 from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army,<sp>
</sp>

 destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all. [the Emperor bows to Mulan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan. Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit. Mulan looks up then turns around hardly<sp>
</sp>

 believing what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate<sp>
</sp>

 on the ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her. Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his<sp>
</sp>

 back]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: My little baby's all grown up and savin' China. [to Cri-Kee] You have a tissue?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: Chi Fu,&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu: Your Excellency?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [muttering to himself]: A member of your coun...[realizing what the Emperor has said]<sp>
</sp>

 what? [stutters] But there are no council positions open, your Majesty.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor [to Mulan]: Very well then, you can have his job [pointing out Chi Fu].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Chi Fu [wobbling to and fro]: What?...My...[faints]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]: With all due respect, your Excellency. I<sp>
</sp>

 have been away from home long enough.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor [taking off his pendant]: Then take this, so your family will know what you have done<sp>
</sp>

 for me. And this [handing her the sword of Shan-Yu] so the world will know what you have done for<sp>
</sp>

 China.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Yao: Is she allowed to do that? [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling. Chien-Po comes up and lifts<sp>
</sp>

 all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug. Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground<sp>
</sp>

 again. Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him. As Shang begins to speak Mulan starts<sp>
</sp>

 to smile anticipating something good]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: Um...[Mulan grins] You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan [smile turning into disappointment]: Oh, thank you. [Mulan walks toward Khan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]: Hmm.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan mounts Khan]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Khan, let's go home.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground<sp>
</sp>

 level. The crowd cheers al the while. The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor [to Shang]: The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of<sp>
</sp>

 all.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [dumbfounded]: Sir?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Emperor: You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty. [The emperor puts on his hat and walks<sp>
</sp>

 back up the steps to his palace]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree. A blossom falls and lands<sp>
</sp>

 on his leg. Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father. Fa Zhou sees her<sp>
</sp>

 approaching and starts to stand]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: Mulan. &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of<sp>
</sp>

 the Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou]. [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the Fa<sp>
</sp>

 Family.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of<sp>
</sp>

 Mulan. He bends down and holds her arms outstretched]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Zhou: The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter. [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan's<sp>
</sp>

 tear then hugs Mulan] I've missed you so.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: I've missed you too Baba.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Fa Li [sighing]: Ahhhhh&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa: Great, she brings home a sword. If you ask me she should have brought home a<sp>
</sp>

 ma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [just arriving]: Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Grandma Fa's mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan's position. Shang walks<sp>
</sp>

 toward Mulan and Fa Zhou]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa: Woo, sign me up for the next war.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently]: Honorable Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up.<sp>
</sp>

 Shang sees her and speaks insecurely] Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet. Ah but well, actually it's<sp>
</sp>

 your helmet, isn't it?...[handing the helmet toward Fa Zhou] I mean...&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over. Mulan holds the helmet Shang<sp>
</sp>

 offers]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Would you like to stay for dinner?&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Grandma Fa [speaking from stage right]: Would you like to stay forever? [Mulan shakes her head<sp>
</sp>

 with a smile at Grandma Fa's statement]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Shang [reassuredly to Mulan]: Dinner would be great.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene through the temple window. He<sp>
</sp>

 watches Mulan hand the helmet back to Fa Zhou. Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First<sp>
</sp>

 Ancestor's his head]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [tugging on First Ancestor's ear]: C'mon, who did a good job? C'mon, tell me who did a<sp>
</sp>

 good job.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [hesitantly]: Oh, all right. You can be a guardian again.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Yeeeeeahhhhhhh. [Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs the gong awakening all the<sp>
</sp>

 ancestors]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu: Take it Cri-Kee.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Song: True to Your Heart -- No characters sing in the song]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Ancestor 1 does a dance from Pulp Fiction while Ancestor 3 does the Hand Jive]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Ancestor 3 [spoken to Ancestor 1]: She get's it from my side of the family.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mushu [spoken while swinging on a chain]: Call out for egg rolls!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [disgusted]: Guardians.&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Mushu lands on the steps outside the temple. Mulan walks up to him and rests besides him on<sp>
</sp>

 the steps]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Mulan: Thanks, Mushu [kisses Mushu on the forehead].&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;Little Brother: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark &lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;[Little brother runs up the steps and into the temple with the bag of grain tied to him. The<sp>
</sp>

 chickens follow him in]&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>

&lt;sp&gt;First Ancestor [annoyed]: Mushu!&lt;/sp&gt;<sp>
</sp>
